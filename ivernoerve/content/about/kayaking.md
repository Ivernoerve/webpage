Sea kayaking has become a true passion of mine, providing both a sense of exploration and an opportunity for playful adventures on the waves. With a solid foundation in technique (BCU-3 star), I am constantly drawn to the vastness of the sea, eager to discover more of our pristine marine environments. The peaceful serenity of gliding through calm waters contrasts beautifully with the exhilaration of riding waves and mastering the dynamic forces of the ocean. As I continue to develop my skills, my ultimate aspiration is to become an activity leader, sharing my love for sea kayaking with others and guiding them to experience the awe-inspiring beauty of our coastal landscapes.
