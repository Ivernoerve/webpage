I am a 26-year-old man currently living in Stavanger, working within the field of data.

In December 2023, I finished my master's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics at the University of Tromsø. During my master's, I specialized in statistics and machine learning, and I also took extra credits in various programming courses. Initially, my passion for physics and mathematics led me to study to become a high school teacher. However, in my third year, I took a course in pattern recognition and was completely blown away. This led me to change my degree, a decision I don't regret for a second.

My interest in teaching still runs deep, and I believe my years studying to become a teacher have taught me essential soft skills that are incredibly helpful when working as a developer. While my focus shifted towards machine learning, my passion for physics and mathematics remains unwavering. My background in these disciplines has equipped me with a wide set of tools, such as problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I fill my time with a variety of hobbies. Listed below are some of my favorite activities at the moment. Sadly, as I have relocated to Stavanger, I no longer have the same easy access to backcountry skiing as I did in Tromsø.
