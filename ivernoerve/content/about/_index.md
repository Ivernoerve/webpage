Hi my name is Iver (as you might have figured out by now). I´m a 
Norwegian born and raised residing in Tromsø, as I am currently a student 
at UiT (the university of Tromsø).  



Mathematics and physics has always been fascinating subjects when growing up, 
so when I applied for a university program it was obvious that I had to explore these subjects further.
For thee and a half years I studied to become a high-school teacher in physics, this changed during the autumn of 2021 because of one course. This course was called "Pattern recognition" which delved into the world of machine learning, and from the start I was hooked! For each new algorithm I Implementing such as Neural networks, K-means, or KNN, my interest grew. Realizing that I would never be able to apply this knowledge as a high school teacher led me to substitute my program to my current one being Applied physics and mathematics.

Listed below is a selection of my many hobbies:
