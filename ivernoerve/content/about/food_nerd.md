At an early age I had to come to the realization that I didn't excel at sports to any degree, thus i had to find 'my thing', The answer was found in the kitchen! Trying new recipies and adding my oen touch to them has been a fun and tasteful hobby, as well as it has given me time to relax with something I enjoy to do everyday no matter how hectic life is at times.
