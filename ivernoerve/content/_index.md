I am a master degree student in applied physics and mathematics at the university of Troms√∏ specialising in machine learning and remote sensing techniques. I have a special interest in graph theory as the relational nature makes it a strong tool to solve dynamic problems as well as structuring data.

Currently starting my last year, delivering my master thesis in december 2023.
