Welcome to my page!

I am a newly graduated applied physisist working in the field of Data, currently as a data Engineer, but with interests in analytics and science as well.

From my academic background I have an interest in Machine learning, especially the image domain, graph theory and remote sensing. Alongside with i am interested in programming and code quality

Over time I also developed a deep interest in coding. While evolving this skill, I found the aspects of 'clean code' very important, especially when transitioning into the industry. 


I found this to be very true in terms of minimizing technical debt, especially when working in a bigger project as maintaining good code quality is essential for creating, and maintaining robust and scalable systems.
