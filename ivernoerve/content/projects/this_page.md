A side project of mine to get more comfortable with html and css, as well as a perfect platform to share some of my personal projects, as well as a way to share some of my favorite recipes and scribles.

The page is based on the [hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework, I considered using a more typical framework such as react however I did not feel I needed the functions it provided and would rather keep it lightweight. 

The page is divided into three subpages, an about page to show some of my interests, a projects page to show off some projects I have done. And lastly a notes page where I post recipes, goals, and scribbles of stuff i find fascinating.
