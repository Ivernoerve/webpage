A list of some of my most noteworthy goals of 2023! Why do I publish this you may ask? In that case read this [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2018/04/15/neuroscience-explains-why-you-need-to-write-down-your-goals-if-you-actually-want-to-achieve-them/?sh=4bdc6a1e7905) article listing the advanages it has. The list is in no particular order!


1. Finish my master in applied physics!

    Since I will be handing in my thesis december this year it is a natural goal for me this year. 

2. Improve my sleep routine

    I vary my bedtime quite which has created a quite unpredictable start for my day which in turn dictates how much time of the day I have to spend on various tasks such as studies, work, and hobbies. I aim to improve my sleeping routine in 2023 to give myself a more predictive day to plan my work routine. 



3. Become an activity leader in the norwegian sea kayaking foundation.
    
    Having taken the technique course in 2022 I can now take the activity leader course which will allow me to hold basic sea kayaking courses, as well as leading unexperienced kayakers on trips.
    




4. Become proficient in a new programming language 

    My main language is without a doubt python, it is without a doubt where I have the most experience! Through some various projects and classes IÂ´ve been introduced to the basics of many languages such as php, js, R, C, and shellscripting (bash / zsh), this is great, however I would like to sink more time into one language rather than learning the basics of many. The yearly stackoverflow [survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) has seen rust at the top for a couple of years now making it a good candidate as a lower level language, the other candidate is Julia as a tool for intense numerical calculations.
