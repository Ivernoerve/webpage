A cake recipe from my mother, this classic carrot cake is fluffy and tasty, especially with enough frosting on top! (There can never be enough). Being very quick to put together, this cake is perfect when you're on a short deadline.

### Ingredients
#### Cake

* 4 eggs
* 3 dl sugar
* 3 dl flour
* 3 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 3 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp vanilla sugar
* 1/2 dl soybean oil
* 4 1/2 dl finely grated carrot

#### Frosting

* 125 grams natural cream cheese
* 125 grams powdered sugar
* 30 grams butter
* 1 tsp vanilla sugar

### Method
1. Set the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
2. Mix the eggs and sugar until fluffy (Eggnog).
3. Sift the dry ingredients into the mixture, add the soybean oil and grated carrots, and mix together.
4. Line the bottom of a 24 cm round baking tray with a baking sheet, and butter the sides of the tray.
5. Pour the batter into the tray, and bake for 30 minutes in the middle of the oven.
6. Remove the cake from the tray and let it rest on a grated oven rack.

While the cake is cooling down, make the frosting:

7. Mix together room-temperature butter and powdered sugar.
8. Add the cream cheese and vanilla sugar (and other aromatics if you want, such as lemon zest).
9. Add the frosting to the cake when it has cooled down. (The frosting can be stored in a container and applied before serving.)
