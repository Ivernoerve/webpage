The upcoming summer will be the last summer spent as a student, that means I will have my final summer internship!

This summer I will be working with the [UiT machine learning group](https://machine-learning.uit.no) working with Polar weather prediction with grap neural networks. The project is part of a larger research project, and thus focuses on a smaller aspect. The end-goal will be to find a new, efficient, Graph neural netrork models for weather prediction. During this project I will alnalyse weather data gathered from a sensor array scattered across Norway using graph theory, network science and ml methods. 


Parallel to this I will continue my work as a part time developer at [n√∏rve](https://noerve.com), to keep developing my programming capabilities in a different field from data analasis and ml. The summer is closing in and I'm greatly looking forward to starting on these projects! (Just need to survive the dreaded exam time first...)
